| DVD9 | ISO | OPL 1.2.0 beta 1948 | USB | 6 | YES | NO | YES | YES | Working | @INDRAPhilip | SCPH-39001 | There is obstruction and slowness in the FMVs of the introduction, the Game has a delay difference of 1 minute 33 seconds compared to its iso version and activate mode 6, otherwise the controls will not work both ps2, ps3, among others possibly. The game is over 4 GB, so you can only test on devices with exfat or fat32 in .ul! PS: ISO has 4.95 GB and ZSO in 4.75 GB, in this case I do not recommend using in ZSO.
