| DVD5 | ISO | 1.1.0, OPL 1.2.0 beta 1940 | USB | | YES | YES | YES | YES | Working |The game works well the introduction and the beginning of the game has no crashes in FMVs, however, to start the game and start seeing more detailed scenes to run game, will have several obstructions in FMVs.
| DVD5 | ZSO | OPL 1.2.0 beta 1940 | USB | | YES | YES | YES | YES | Working | It will have several obstructions in FMVs in ZSO format for me, it is useless to use it with this game, the size difference is minimal and there are much more flaws in FMVs. PS: ISO size 4.19 GB and in ZSO 4.15 GB!
